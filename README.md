# The Euclidean Algorithm implementation with the LCM

This program coded entirely in Python version 3.9 is built upon the deductive logic of two declarative statements I've proven before: the Euclidean Algorithm's highest common factor and the LCM. With this program I demonstrate the capability of those results by providing my implementation of the results into this program.

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. Standard compilation is all that is needed.

```shell
python Euclidean_Algorithm_and_LCM.py
```

Once the code is executed, you will be provided with a prompt asking you which integers you'd like to input in order to compute the highest common factor, along with the lowest common multiple.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/faycalki/Euclidean_Algorithm_and_LCM.git
```

## Features

* Efficiently computes the greatest common divisor of any two integers, as well as their lowest common multiple.
* Minimal dependencies (no external packages or modules loaded).
* Can be implemented as a fully modular program with minimal editing.
